\section{Thesis overview and aims}
\label{intro-sec:overview}

While tumour heterogeneity is a well accepted concept by now, there is a need for computational methods assessing and visualising this heterogeneity. This work aims to contribute to this unmet need by developing three different custom made tools to infer and monitor tumour heterogeneity. I have completed the work in the following three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Development of two joint somatic variant calling workflows and the impact of these on downstream analysis (\autoref{ch:variantcalling}). 
	\item Analysis of five rapid autopsy probands with state of the art methods to investigate tumour heterogeneity and development of a mitochondrial based phylogeny reconstruction method (\autoref{ch:cascade}). 
	\item Development of a read-centric method to detect somatic mutational signatures from low coverage whole genome sequencing (\autoref{ch:mmf}).
\end{enumerate}
