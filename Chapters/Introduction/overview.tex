\section{Thesis overview and aims}
\label{intro-sec:overview}

While genomic tumour heterogeneity is now a well accepted concept, there remains a need for computational methods to assess and visualise this heterogeneity. This work aims to contribute to this unmet need by developing three different custom made tools to infer and monitor genomic tumour heterogeneity. I have completed the work in the following three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Development of two joint somatic variant calling workflows and the impact of these on downstream analysis (\autoref{ch:variantcalling}). 
	\item Analysis of five rapid autopsy probands with state of the art methods to investigate multi-regional tumour heterogeneity and development of a mitochondrial based phylogeny reconstruction method (\autoref{ch:cascade}). 
	\item Development of a read-centric method to detect somatic mutational signatures from low coverage whole genome sequencing (\autoref{ch:mmf}).
\end{enumerate}
