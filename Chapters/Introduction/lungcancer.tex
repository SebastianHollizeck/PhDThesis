\section{Lungcancer}
\label{intro-sec:lungcancer}

With around 1.6 million deaths world-wide each year, lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death \cite{Siegel2018}. Every year about twelve thousand Australians get diagnosed with lung cancer. These cases can be generally split into two groups: small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), which account for around 15\% and 85\% of cases, respectively. The majority of NSCLC are either lung adenocarcinoma or lung squamous cell carcinoma \cite{Molina2008}. Even though smoking is highly associated with lung cancers, there is a big group of never smokers, with a high risk of lung cancers in East Asia, especially women, which is correlated with outside influences like pollution and occupational carcinogens and paired with genetic susceptibility \cite{Sun2007}.
