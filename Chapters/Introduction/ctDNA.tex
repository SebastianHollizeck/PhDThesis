\section[cfDNA]{Cell free DNA is more than just bits and pieces}
\label{intro-sec:ctDNA}

When a cell from a multicellular organism dies, through which ever method, there will be numerous enzymes involved, which clear the debris and recycle material. This means that proteases digest proteins into amino acids, which will later be used for either building new proteins or possibly even digested further for energy production. The same happens with the DNA in the cell when it is released following cell death. However, as discussed in the previous section~\ref{intro-sec:DNA} the DNA is wrapped around histones and organised in structures called nucleosomes. These protect the DNA from being cut by DNAases by hindering the access to the DNA, similar to how they stopped the access for transcription into RNA. This then in turn leads to the DNA being cut in the linker regions between nucleosomes into fragments mainly in the length of 167 base pairs (bp). 

These DNA fragments, which are called cell free DNA (cfDNA), can then be readily detected in bodily fluids, like blood, urine or even stool. By analysing these fragments, non invasive tests for prenatal care have been made possible, as the DNA of the developing foetus can be detected in the mother's blood \cite{Dan2012,Nicolaides2013}.

Similar to this process, a cancer also sheds DNA, titled ``circulating tumour DNA`` (ctDNA), when its cells die, either through intervention of the immune system, cancer therapies or other processes. These ctDNA fragments can similarly be analysed and molecular properties measured, without even knowing the exact location of the tumour. As a blood test can be routinely performed in the clinic, the monitoring of cancer progression is significantly easier and safer than through other measures. Of course, it is, similar to the prenatal test, acting as a proxy for the cells which are still alive, which have have not yet shed their DNA. Additionally, the amount of shedded DNA is highly variable between tumours, with a general higher amount seen in later stages when tumour burden is high \cite{Diehl2008,Schwarzenbach2011}.

ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) patients and panel of healthy controls. The vertical dashed lines are placed on the fragment sizes between 52 and 172 bp where 10 bp periodicity is observed. The vertical lines at 240 and 324 bp show the range at which a shift in the di-nucleosomal peak occurs between HGSOC patients and healthy controls. The inset plot enlarges the density profile in the di-nucleosomal fragment length range. Figure adopted from \textcite{Markus2022}}\label{fig:ctdnaFragSize}

Due to the different biological processes which can lead to the release of DNA from cancer cells, in addition to apoptosis, which is the main source of cfDNA from healthy cells, ctDNA has several biological differences to cfDNA. The most prominent features observed are distinct ctDNA fragmentation size patterns, fragment start sites, and fragment ends motives. While the preferred end motive and start site are heavily correlated, restricting the analysis to the lower tail of the mono- and di-nuclesomal peak of the fragment size distribution (74-155bp and 240-325bp) allowed a ctDNA tumour signal enrichment of at least 28\%. This is enrichment and the high periodicity of the distribution showed a high dependence on nucleosomal placement. All ctDNA features combined were shown to be able to predict the presence or absence of tumour DNA in a samples regardless of tumour type  (\autoref{fig:ctdnaFragSize}, \cite{Mouliere2018,Markus2022}).
