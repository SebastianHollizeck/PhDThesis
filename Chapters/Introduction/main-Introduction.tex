This first introduction chapter contains all the necessary background information as well as an overview of the work discussed in this thesis. It summarises basic biological properties of DNA and cell biology as well as the respective technologies to read, analyse and measure these biological concepts and then how to evaluate the output of these methods.
\hyperref[intro-sec:DNA]{Section~\ref*{intro-sec:DNA}} delineates the role DNA plays for the cell and then \hyperref[intro-sec:ctDNA]{section~\ref{intro-sec:ctDNA}} shows how these standards are changed in the tumour and cell free context. \hyperref[intro-sec:sequencing]{Section~\ref{intro-sec:sequencing}} introduces the current technologies used to measure and detect DNA and its variations. \hyperref[intro-sec:analysis]{Section~\ref*{intro-sec:analysis}} covers the computational methods developed to read out changes in the DNA. Then \hyperref[intro-sec:lungcancer]{section~\ref{intro-sec:lungcancer}} relates how these changes lead to cancer and what we can learn from them. 
The introduction concludes with \hyperref[intro-sec:overview]{section~\ref*{intro-sec:overview}} as an overview of the aims of the thesis and my work in addressing them in the following chapters.
