heterogeneity is a known concept, but methods to measure and quantify are lacking

Joint variant calling is mandatory when using multiple samples (which is the only way to do heterogeneity)
Even in a world of single cell, old data and clinical data will not likely be single cell soon.

Mitochondrial variants allow assessment of temporal history due to their quicker mutation rate, small cell not solved yet

MisMatchFinder allows measurement of tumour heterogeneity over time/ evolution with no prior knowledge in a clinical background (very cheap)

Good step forward, but many missing heterogeneities (epigenetic and transcriptional) longitudinal only scraped with methods being applicable -> downstream analysis is still lacking with the amount of data available
