\section[Usage]{Usage - its not just me that thinks it is good}
As published software is amazing, its real value is in the re-usability and portability. Many published software packages are not maintained or not even functional even though they are published. While I developed these joint somatic variant calling workflows to deal with a challenge I faced, many other people even just at the same institute have already shown interest and some research groups are already using the software to analyse their multi-sample data.

\end{figure}

To have some proxy of the usage statistics of the workflows, I recorded the download numbers of the ``dawsontoolkit`` docker container, which only contains software for refiltering and joint analysis of the workflows after the publication of the manuscript. Obviously, this is an imperfect measurement, as people can reuse a downloaded container as often as they want, which would not appear in the count and similarly, just because the container was downloaded, the analysis might not have been used. However it still shows  an interaction and an interest in the methods. The download numbers show a quick increase in numbers in the beginning, just after the publication, followed by a short plateau  but then another increase (\autoref{fig:usageStats}). This suggests, that there is a need in the methods, rather than a simple curiosity after publication.
