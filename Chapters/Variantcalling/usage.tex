\section[Usage]{Usage statistics and uptake}
\label{variantcalling-sec:usage}
Ultimately when choosing research software, publication and citations are not a good metric to evaluate the quality of a method \cite{Gardner2022}. Many published software packages are not maintained or not even functional even though they are published. While we developed these joint somatic variant calling workflows to deal with a challenge we faced, the interest of others was continuously expressed by bother members of the bioinformatics community whenever we presented this work.

\end{figure}

To have some proxy of the usage statistics of the workflows, we recorded the download numbers of the ``dawsontoolkit`` docker container after the publication of the manuscript. The container only consists of software for refiltering and joint analysis of the workflows . Obviously, this is an imperfect measurement, as people can reuse a downloaded container as often as they want, which would not appear in the count and similarly, just because the container was downloaded, the analysis might not have been used. Nevertheless, it still shows  an interaction and an interest in the methods. The download numbers show a sustained and stable increase in downloads (\autoref{fig:usageStats}). This suggests, that there is a need in the methods, rather than a simple curiosity after publication, which hopefully will facilitate a higher quality analysis of future projects and therefore lead to a better understanding of cancer evolution and heterogeneity.
