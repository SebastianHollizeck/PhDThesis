While the initial motivation for the development of these tools was the analysis of multi-region, so spatial, samples from the same patient coming from the CASCADE rapid autopsy program, a longitudinal application of these methods for the joint analysis of diagnostic and relapse sample, or even the repeated testing of ctDNA are quite worth thinking about. In this part, I will present work using the published workflows on other datasets, which highlights the flexibility and wide spread use of our new methods.
