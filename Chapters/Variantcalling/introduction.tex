When I started exploring the somatic variant calling methods in the beginning of my PhD in 2018, I was surprised about the stark difference between germline and somatic variant calling methods. Where all "modern" germline variant callers have the built-in capability to joint call multiple samples, for example from family trios, virtually no somatic variant caller had this function.
