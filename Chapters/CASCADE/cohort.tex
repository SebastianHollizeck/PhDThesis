ideas:\\
loss of heterozygosity \\
long stem and explosion of small cell transformation\\
potentially move this after the mitochondrial analysis to put that in as well.


\subsection{Small cell transformation}

\begin{itemize}
\item hypothesised high amount of drug resistant subclones in sclc
\item high TP53/RB1 mutation amount but not required.
\item FHIT deletion in all samples
\item MAD1 deletion common
\end{itemize}
