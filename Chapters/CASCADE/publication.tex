\section{Publications}
\label{cascade-sec:publication}

This chapter includes and reproduces data analysis that contributed to two publications, however as they were not sole first author publications, they are only mentioned here instead of included in full. 
The first publication features the resistance mechanism of small cell transformation seen in patient CA-L (\autoref{cascade-sec:CA86}) (\textit{\citetitle{Burr2019}}~\textcite{Burr2019}) of one of the patients and the second shows the discovery of emerging novel resistance mutations in a RET-fusion driven NSCLC in patient CA-A (\autoref{cascade-sec:CA99}) (\textit{\citetitle{Solomon2020}}~\textcite{Solomon2020}).
