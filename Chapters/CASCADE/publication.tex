\section{Publications}
\label{cascade-sec:publication}

This chapter includes and reproduces data analysis also shown in two publications, however due to the restriction of the university for sole first author, they are only mentioned here instead of included. 
The first publication features the resistance mechanism of small cell transformation (\textit{\citetitle{Burr2019}}~\textcite{Burr2019}) of one of the patients and the second shows the discovery of an emerging novel resistance to a targeted RET-fusion driven cancer (\textit{\citetitle{Solomon2020}}~\textcite{Solomon2020}).
