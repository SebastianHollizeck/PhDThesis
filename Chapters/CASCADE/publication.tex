This chapter includes the data analysis for two two publications.
The first publication features the resistance mechanism of small cell transformation (\href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2019.08.008}{\nolinkurl{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2019.08.008}}\cite{Burr2019}) and the second shows the discovery of resistance to a targeted RET-fusion driven cancer (\href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.01.006}{\nolinkurl{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2020.01.006}}\cite{Solomon2020})
