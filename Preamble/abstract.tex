Intra-patient tumour heterogeneity is a widely accepted cause of resistance to therapy \cite{DagogoJack2017,Fisher2013}, but the possibility to study this phenomenon is so far underexplored as the acquisition of multi region data sets can be ethically challenging \cite{Leong2018}. With circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) as a proxy it is possible to analyse a snapshot of the unified heterogeneity, but there is still an unmet need for new analysis methods to optimize the analysis of these very valuable data and drive new treatment targets \cite{Yan2019}.

In this work we developed new methods to study genetic heterogeneity from next generation sequencing (NGS) of tumour tissue as well as ctDNA to elucidate the role of tumour heterogeneity on treatment resistance.
