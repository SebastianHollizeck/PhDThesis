%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{\hyperref[ch:intro]{Chapter~\ref*{ch:intro}}:} Introduction is an original work providing background and overview relevant to understanding the thesis and its relevance to the field. It includes an introduction to DNA, ctDNA, DNA sequencing, somatic variant calling and lung cancer.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{\hyperref[ch:variantcalling]{Chapter~\ref*{ch:variantcalling}}:} Joint somatic variant calling is an original work describing two workflows for the joint analysis of multiple related tumour samples and has been published in \textit{Bioinformatics} as "Custom workflows to improve joint variant calling from multiple related tumour samples: FreeBayesSomatic and Strelka2Pass" on 21$^{st}$ September 2021. In addition to the published analysis, I have added longitudinal analysis and its evaluation as well as the impact of this new method on other downstream analysis, like phylogenetic reconstruction and clonal deconvolution.

Contributions for this chapter:
\begin{itemize}
	\item I conceptualised the work
	\item I implemented the workflows and containerised all required tools
	\item I performed the data simulation
	\item I performed the analysis presented in the publication
	
%\begingroup\interlinepenalty=10000
	\item I wrote the draft of the manuscript and performed revisions
	\item D.C. and S-J.D. provided advice in planning and writing the manuscript
	\item D.C. provided guidance for method development
	\item S-J.D. provided guidance for method evaluation
	\item S.W. performed the targeted amplicon validation
	\item S.W. and  B.S. read the draft manuscript and provided feedback
	\item B.S. provided clinical expertise for human data
